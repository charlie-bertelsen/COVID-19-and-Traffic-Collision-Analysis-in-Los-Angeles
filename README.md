### Project Overview

As COVID-19 cases surged and strict stay-at-home orders were implemented, many businesses transitioned to remote work, schools closed, and non-essential travel was discouraged or prohibited altogether. These changes led to a significant decrease in the number of vehicles on the road.

This project presents an in-depth analysis of the correlation between traffic collisions and the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Los Angeles, California, one of the largest cities in the U.S. and notorious for bad traffic.

The goal of this project is to identify whether a relationship exists between the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths and traffic collisions in Los Angeles. By examining trends during the pandemic, this analysis aims to discover how public health measures and behavioral shifts may have influenced road safety in a large urban environment.

### Project Questions

1. Is there a correlation between the number of COVID-19 deaths/cases and the number of traffic collisions in Los Angeles?
  
2. If there is a correlation found between this variables what is the nature of the relationship and what can we learn from it?

3. Which regression model is the most accuracte and can it be used to make future predictions?

### Data Sources

The data for this project was collected from the data.gov website. There are two .csv files that were exported from the website and then processed and analyzed in R studio:

1. The first dataset contains information on the number of deaths, cases, new cases and new deaths for both the city of Los Angeles and the State of California.
2019-2023

LA County Covid Cases: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/la-county-covid-cases

2. The second dataset contains information on traffic collisions reported in Los Angeles. This dataset includes the date and time of the collision, the geographical information of the incident and the victim demographics.

### Limitations

1. Strong correlation =/= causation: While there is a significant negative correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases/deaths and the number of traffic collisions in Los Angeles, it does not necesarily mean that the pandemic...
   
2. The traffic dataset contains only reported collisions: A significant amount of traffic collisions go unreported and the percentage of unreported collisions may have changed during the pandemic pointing to more inaccuracies in the data.
