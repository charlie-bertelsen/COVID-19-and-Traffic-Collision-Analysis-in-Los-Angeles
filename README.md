### Project Overview

During the COVID-19 lockdown, the entire country was trying to decrease social interactions and people were ordered to stay home in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus...

This is an in-depth analysis on the correlation between the number of traffic collisions and the nuumber of covid cases/deaths in Los Angeles, one of the nations largests cities notorious for its bad traffic.

### Project Questions

1. Is there a correlation between the number of COVID-19 deaths/cases and the number of traffic collisions in Los Angeles?
  
2. If there is a correlation found between this variables what is the nature of the relationship and what can we learn from it?

3. Which regression model is the most accuracte and can it be used to make future predictions?

### Data Sources

### Limitations

1. Strong correlation =/= causation: While there is a significant negative correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases/deaths and the number of traffic collisions in Los Angeles, it does not necesarily mean that the pandemic...
   
2. The traffic dataset contains only reported collisions: A significant amount of traffic collisions go unreported and the percentage of unreported collisions may have changed during the pandemic pointing to more inaccuracies in the data.
